# fast-sim-design

A virtual environment for fast agent-based simulation design. **Development in progress** (written in Modern C++ (17), with most recent features)

Design your world with [TiledMapEditor](https://www.mapeditor.org/), make it alive with FastSimDesign.

The code of FastSimDesign was written (then at least I tried) with the permanent concern that it be of **high quality** by following the advices of *Code Complete* (Steve McConnell, 2004), *Effective Modern C++* (Scott Meyers, 2014), *Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied* (Andrei Alexandrescu, 2001), *The Art of Readable Code* (Dustin Boswell and Trevor Foucher, 2011) and *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship* (Robert Martin, 2008).
