# By default, you don't need to manually initialize these variables: this is
# done by the glob functions `directory()`. But if after all you decide
# to use you own instructions, then remove all functions with the exception of 
# all `set()`. Follow the instructions of each variable to know how initialize them.
#
# Warning: in all case if you don't use precompiled header features, set to
# empty string the variables `${PROJECT_NAME}_PRECOMPILED_HEADER_FILE` and
# `${PROJECT_NAME}_PRECOMPILED_SOURCE_FILE`.
