# What Is This?
# -------------
# In this file, you will set the configuration of each cpack generator. This
# file is configured at cmake time, but loaded at the beginning of cpack time,
# when you execute the `cpack()` command. It allows per-generator setting of
# `CPACK_*` variables at cpack time. To pass variables to cpack from cmake,
# they must be configured in this file. More informations here:
# https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CPack.html#cpack-generators.
# You can see an example of using here:
# https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/blob/master/CMakeCPackOptions.cmake.in
# and you will find all variables according to you generator here:
# https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cpack-generators.7.html

# See https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/cpack_gen/wix.html#cpack_gen:CPack%20WIX%20Generator.
